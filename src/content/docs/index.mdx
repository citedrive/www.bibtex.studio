## A Short Guide to BibTeX

### What is BibTeX?
BibTeX is a tool used to manage references in LaTeX documents. It helps you organize and format your bibliography, which is a list of sources you’ve cited in your work. BibTeX works with a `.bib` file where all your references are stored.

### BibTeX Entry Types
BibTeX has several types of entries to cover different kinds of sources:

- **article**: For journal articles.
- **book**: For books.
- **inbook**: For a part of a book, such as a chapter.
- **inproceedings**: For papers presented at conferences.
- **misc**: For miscellaneous sources that don't fit other types.
- **phdthesis**: For PhD theses.
- **mastersthesis**: For Master’s theses.
- **techreport**: For technical reports.

### BibTeX Fields
Each entry type has fields to store specific information:

- **author**: The author(s) of the work.
- **title**: The title of the work.
- **year**: The year of publication.
- **journal**: The journal name (for articles).
- **publisher**: The publisher of the book.
- **pages**: The page numbers (for articles or book chapters).
- **volume**: The volume number (for journal articles).
- **number**: The issue number (for journal articles).
- **address**: The publisher's address.
- **edition**: The edition of the book.
- **institution**: The institution that published the report or thesis.

### BibTeX Styles
BibTeX uses styles to format your bibliography:

- **plain**: Simple numeric style.
- **unsrt**: Similar to plain but entries are in citation order.
- **alpha**: Uses alphabetic labels (e.g., Jon90 for an article by Jones from 1990).
- **abbrv**: Abbreviates first names, months, and journal names.

### Natbib
Natbib is a package that extends BibTeX, offering more citation options. It allows you to use commands like:

- `\citet{key}`: Textual citation, e.g., "Smith (2020) shows..."
- `\citep{key}`: Parenthetical citation, e.g., "(Smith, 2020)".

### BibLaTeX
BibLaTeX is a more modern and flexible alternative to BibTeX. It offers more features and better support for different citation styles. With BibLaTeX, you can use commands like:

- `\autocite{key}`: Automatically selects citation style based on context.
- `\footcite{key}`: Puts the citation in a footnote.

To use BibLaTeX, include it in your document preamble:

```latex
\usepackage[backend=biber]{biblatex}
\addbibresource{yourbibfile.bib}
```

### CiteDrive
CiteDrive is an online tool that helps manage and share BibTeX files collaboratively. It integrates with Overleaf and other LaTeX editors, allowing multiple users to work on the same bibliography file. It offers features like real-time updates, version control, and easy sharing of bibliographies.

### Example BibTeX Entry
Here is a simple example of a BibTeX entry for a journal article:

```bibtex
@article{key,
  author = {John Doe},
  title = {An Example Article},
  journal = {Journal of Examples},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {42},
  pages = {123-456},
}
```

### Summary
BibTeX is essential for managing references in LaTeX documents. It supports different entry types and fields to cover various sources. Natbib and BibLaTeX extend BibTeX's functionality, offering more citation styles and options. CiteDrive provides an online platform for collaborative bibliography management.
